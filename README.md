# CHALLENGE-EasyCrypto
Goal: Find a way to break the crypto and decrypt that ciphertext without knowing the key. (The key I put in there is just for demo purposes.)

Basically just chuck your data and key into the vars at the bottom and it will give you the ciphertext. I have provided a ciphertext to break too, (basically I've provided you with the cipher, the code at the bottom will encrypt some text for you with a given key, there's a 4-byte key and an ASCII message.)
